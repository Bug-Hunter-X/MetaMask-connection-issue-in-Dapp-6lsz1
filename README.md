# MetaMask Connection Issue in Dapp

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when connecting a Dapp to MetaMask: the Dapp fails to recognize or connect to the installed and enabled MetaMask wallet.

## Bug Description

The provided JavaScript code attempts to check if MetaMask is connected.  If MetaMask is detected, it logs the selected address. However, in certain scenarios, even with a properly installed and enabled MetaMask, the Dapp fails to detect it, resulting in the 'Make sure you have metamask!' message being logged.

## Solution

The bug likely stems from asynchronous operations and insufficient error handling. The solution involves explicitly requesting account access from MetaMask using `ethereum.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' })` and handling potential errors using async/await or promises.
